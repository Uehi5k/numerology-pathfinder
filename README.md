# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

This project is an experiment. Using AI tool to do "vibe coding" and how much it can help wit the process. Being curious with this "vibe coding" thing, I am keen on learning and how to best use this tool.
At the moment, I do not have much knowledge or skills when it comes to React framework, therefore having a tool like this can generate and I, myself can check the code to see manually, or getting the tool
to fix the problem.

There are limitations on how many prompts you can do per day with Lovable so I am planning to see what features I would like to have and prepare the prompt carefully to take advantage of this limitation.

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/1b930ca5-35e0-42a2-9642-b7d2da2b6160) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
