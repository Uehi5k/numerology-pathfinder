# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

This project is an experiment. Using AI tool to do "vibe coding" and how much it can help wit the process. Being curious with this "vibe coding" thing, I am keen on learning and how to best use this tool.
At the moment, I do not have much knowledge or skills when it comes to React framework, therefore having a tool like this can generate and I, myself can check the code to see manually, or getting the tool
to fix the problem.

There are limitations on how many prompts you can do per day with Lovable so I am planning to see what features I would like to have and prepare the prompt carefully to take advantage of this limitation.

## TODO
- Language translation on across the app.
- Include Dark Mode.

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/1b930ca5-35e0-42a2-9642-b7d2da2b6160) and start prompting.
